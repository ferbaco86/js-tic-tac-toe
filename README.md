# js-tic-tac-toe
A collaborative project of a tic-tac-toe game aimed at allowing two users to play against each other. The game is capable of ending in 3 states: with a winner, loser, and a draw. Each user after entering their names are given a symbol that identifies them on the board.

## Requirements
  - Ensure that you have node modules installed on your computer
  - Have a browser that supports HTML 5
  
## Features
Some of the features of this project include but not limited to:
  
  - Simple animated intro
  - 8-bit retro feel for the game UI
  - Inputs for registering players names
  - For this implementation, player one will have the symbol "X" and player two the symbol "O"

## Instructions
  - Make your first move by clicking on the board where you want to position your symbol
  - Wait for the other player to do the same
  - The first player to create a three-in-a-row sequence of their symbol wins
  - The sequence can either be vertical, horizontal, or diagonal
  - If all squares are occupied by a symbol and there is no winning combination then the game is considered a tie
